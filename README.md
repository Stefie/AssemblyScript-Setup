# AssemblyScript-Setup
Initial AssemblyScript projects setup 

Just an Assemblyscript starter project created with the Quick-Start guide that uses `yarn` instead of `npm`:

https://docs.assemblyscript.org/quick-start

```
// install dependencies
yarn install

// To build the WASM files
yarn run build
```
